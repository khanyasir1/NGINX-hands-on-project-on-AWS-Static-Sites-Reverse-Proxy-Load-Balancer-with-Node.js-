## Part 1: What is a Web Server? (Simple and Practical Explanation)

A **web server** is a system that **hosts websites and delivers web content to users' browsers** upon request. In simple terms, it listens for requests from your browser and sends back the web pages or files you want to see.

- When you type a URL like `www.google.com` in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), your browser sends a **request** to the server where Google's website is stored.
- The web server **finds the requested files** (like HTML for the webpage structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity).
- The web server **sends these files back** to your browser.
- Your browser combines these files and renders the web page you see.


### Real-Life Example:

Imagine a **librarian** in a large library. You ask the librarian for a specific book (your request). The librarian goes and finds the book (the requested content) and hands it back to you. The librarian here is like the web server—the ‘middleman’ between your request and the content.

### Types of Web Servers

1. **Software Web Servers**
These are programs that run on computers to handle web requests.
    - Examples: **Apache**, **Nginx** (top popular choices today).
2. **Hardware Servers**
Physical machines that store web data and run server software. They may be located in massive data centers.
    - Example: Big data centers by Google or Amazon have thousands of physical servers hosting many websites.

## Part 2: The Old Problem (Before Nginx)

Before efficient servers like Nginx, web servers like Apache used two main ways to handle requests:

### 1. Process-Based Servers

- For **every user request**, the server **creates a new process** (a full program instance).
- Each process uses its own memory (RAM).
- So, if 10,000 people visit a site at once, 10,000 processes must start — which uses a lot of memory.


### 2. Thread-Based Servers

- Instead of independent processes, the server creates **threads** inside a process.
- Threads are lighter than processes but still consume memory.
- For thousands of users, many threads running simultaneously can still overwhelm the server.


### The Problem: **C10K Problem**

Handling **10,000 concurrent users** created so many processes or threads that servers ran out of memory and crashed.

### Real-Life Example:

Imagine a restaurant with a waiter for **each customer**.

- If 10 customers walk in, 10 waiters are needed.
- If 10,000 customers walk in simultaneously, 10,000 waiters are needed — impossible and chaotic!

***

## Part 3: Nginx Solution

Nginx solves the C10K problem through a new way of working:

### Event-Driven

- Nginx works **only when there is an active request**. If nothing is happening, it stays idle.


### Asynchronous

- Instead of handling one request at a time, Nginx **jumps between requests efficiently**, using the same worker process to manage thousands of connections without waiting idly.


### Restaurant Analogy for Nginx

- **Old-style (Apache)**: Each customer gets their own dedicated waiter → waiters sit idle while customers decide → many waiters required → chaos at peak times.
- **Nginx style**: Few waiters manage many tables → one waiter checks on Table 1’s order, then quickly moves to Table 2 while waiting → waiters multitask efficiently → restaurant runs smoothly even with many customers.

## What is a Web Server?

A web server is software (sometimes hardware) that listens for requests from your browser and sends web pages back in response.

### How It Works

- You type a website address in your browser.
- Browser sends a request to the web server.
- Web server finds the requested webpage files (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Web server sends those files back to your browser.
- Your browser shows the web page.


### Real-Life Example

Think of a librarian who finds a book when you ask for it. The librarian is the web server, and the book is the webpage.

## Types of Web Servers

- **Software servers**: Apache, Nginx (popular choices mostly today).
- **Hardware servers**: Physical computers in big data centers where websites live.

***

## The Old Problem Before Nginx

Earlier web servers handled each visitor by:

- Creating a new **process** (large memory use) for each request.
- Or creating a new **thread** inside a process (less memory but still heavy).

This means if many users visit simultaneously, servers run out of memory and crash—called the **C10K problem** (handling 10,000 simultaneous users).

### Real-Life Example

Imagine a restaurant where each customer needs one waiter. If 10,000 customers come in, you’d need 10,000 waiters, which is impossible.

***

## How Nginx Solves the Problem

Nginx works differently:

- It is **event-driven**: handles requests only as they come.
- It is **asynchronous**: uses fewer waiters (processes) who jump between many customers efficiently.


### Restaurant Analogy

- Old style: One waiter per table.
- Nginx style: Few waiters serve many tables by moving between them, making the restaurant efficient.
